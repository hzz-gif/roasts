            Sometimes a simple roast isn't enough. When you need to deliver a burn that cuts deep and leaves a lasting impression, 
            you need roasts that truly hurt. These devastating burns are designed to hit where it hurts most - but remember, 
            with great power comes great responsibility.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            What separates a playful jab from a devastating burn? It's all about targeting the deepest 
            insecurities and hitting where it hurts most. These roasts don't just attack surface-level 
            traits - they go for the jugular of self-esteem.

                    These roasts are intentionally harsh and should only be used in appropriate contexts.
                    Always consider the impact of your words and the relationship you have with the person.
                    Comedy should bring people together, not tear them apart.

          <p className="text-gray-700 mb-6">
            While these roasts are designed to be devastating, it's crucial to understand when and how to use them responsibly.
            The most effective roasters know that timing, context, and relationship dynamics are everything.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">When NOT to Use These Roasts</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li>Against someone who is already vulnerable or going through a difficult time</li>
            <li>In professional or formal settings</li>
            <li>When the person has asked you to stop</li>
            <li>Against someone who clearly can't handle this level of humor</li>
            <li>When you're genuinely angry - roasts should come from a place of fun, not malice</li>
          </ul>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-4">The Golden Rules of Devastating Roasts</h3>
          <ol className="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 text-gray-700 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Know your audience:</strong> Make sure the person can handle this level of roasting</li>
            <li><strong>Be prepared for retaliation:</strong> If you dish it out, be ready to take it</li>
            <li><strong>Keep it playful:</strong> The goal is laughter, not genuine hurt</li>
            <li><strong>Know when to stop:</strong> Read the room and the person's reactions</li>
            <li><strong>Apologize if needed:</strong> If you go too far, be ready to make amends</li>
          </ol>

          <p className="text-gray-700">
            Remember, the best roasters are also the best at taking roasts. The art of devastating comedy lies not just
            in the delivery, but in knowing when to use these weapons of wit and when to keep them holstered.
