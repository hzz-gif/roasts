          <div className="space-y-3 mb-8">
            <p className="text-gray-800">1. Oh my God! It speaks!</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">2. Rolling your eyes isn't gonna help find your brain.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">3. You are the reason this country puts directions on shampoo bottles.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">4. It whistles, doesn't it? Your head when the wind blows.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">5. I was going to make a joke about you, but I see life beat me to the punch.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">6. You are as useless as the "ueue" in queue.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">7. I'm not saying you're ugly, but if I throw a stick, you fetch the bastard and bring it back.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">8. Whoever told you to be yourself gave you bad advice.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">9. You act like how I would think vomit would act if it could.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">10. I thought of you today, and it reminded me to take out the trash.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">11. I'd give you a nasty look, but you already got one.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">12. I'm not an astronomer, but I am pretty sure the world revolves around the sun, not you.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">13. You and I go way back, and you've always been annoying. I mean, you even used to make your happy meal cry.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">14. It's not that you're annoying; it's just that I'd liken you to the human version of period cramps.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">15. Are you done with all of this drama? Because I need an intermission.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">16. I apologize for doing anything that made you believe I care about how you feel.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">17. Most mistakes can be fixed; you are the exception that proves the rule.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">18. Everyone can act foolish once, but you are violating that privilege.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">19. If you're offended by my opinion, you should hear the ones I keep to myself.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">20. You remind me of a cloud; my day becomes much brighter when you disappear.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">21. If ignorance is bliss, you must be the happiest person on the planet.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">22. If your mum got given one piece of bad advice, it was not to swallow.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">23. You're like the human version of an athlete's foot; annoying and hard to get rid of.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">24. Looking at you reminded me to take my contraception. I can't risk giving birth to someone that ugly.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">25. I'm trying to come up with an insult that's stupid enough for you to understand, so give me a moment.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">26. You're talking to me; I thought you only talked behind my back.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">27. I've seen you before, but I'm sure I had to pay for admission last time.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">28. I am not a proctologist but I know an asshole when I see one.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">29. I love what you've done with your hair. How do you get it to come out of your nostrils like that?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">30. Your face is the same as a restraining order. It makes people stay away.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">31. Your secrets are always safe with me because I never even listen when you tell me them.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">32. I do hate you, I am sure God does too.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">33. So a thought crossed your mind? That must have been a long and lonely journey for you.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">34. I pray you meet your downfall in a pitfall.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">35. If you're going to be two-faced, at least make one of them pretty.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">36. You must have been born on a highway because that's where most accidents happen.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">37. When I look at you, I wonder where you have been all my life… Would you mind returning there?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">38. I'm sorry that my brutal honesty inconvenienced your ego.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">39. Do you think this hurts my feelings? The only thing that hurts is my eyes when I'm looking at you.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">40. Watching you attempt to use all of your vocabulary in a single statement is funny.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">41. Don't feel bad. A lot of people have no talent.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">42. Why don't you go play in traffic?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">43. I never forget a person's face, but I'll be happy to make an exception in your situation.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">44. You should carry a plant around to replace the oxygen you waste.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">45. Some people are like slinkies. They are not good for much, but they bring a smile to your face when pushed down the stairs.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">46. The only reason I go with you everywhere is that I'd rather do that than kiss your ugly face goodbye.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">47. I thought I had the flu, but then I realized your face makes me sick to my stomach.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">48. I could eat a bowl of alphabet soup and poop out a smarter statement than what you said.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">49. I forgot that the rest of the world revolves around you. How foolish of me; my apologies.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">50. When I see your face, the only thing I would change is the direction I was heading to.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">51. I would punch you, but I don't want to improve the appearance of your face.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">52. Accidents happen; the proof is sitting right there.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">53. Is that the brain you use when crossing the road?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">54. You look like something that shouldn't be seen before midnight.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">55. If your brain was put on a fish, it would swim backward.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">56. You look like a rejected omen.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">57. Why are you built like a question mark?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">58. If my life were a movie, you'd be an annoying extra.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">59. Light travels faster than sound, which is why you seemed bright until you spoke.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">60. At least my friends aren't imaginary like your social life.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">61. The only way you'd get hurt from exercising would be if you sprained your finger changing the channel.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-800">65. You look like something that came out of a slow cooker.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">66. I think I found your purpose in life. It is to be an organ donor.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">67. You have an entire life to be an idiot. Why not take today off?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">68. I'm sorry I upset you by calling you a hoe. I was unaware that it was a secret.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">69. Amazingly, you don't allow your knowledge to stand in the way of stupidity.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">70. Don't attempt to think too much. Your stupidity might injure your brain.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">71. Your parents really must have been happily married before they had you.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-800">75. I am not ignoring you. I am simply giving you time to reflect on what an idiot you are.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">76. I keep thinking you can't get any dumber, and you keep proving me wrong.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">77. I'd be broke if I had a dollar for every time you said something smart.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">78. If I wanted a bitch, I would buy a dog.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">79. I apologize if my forced apology sounded fake; I'll work to improve it the next time.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">80. Don't hate me because I'm beautiful. Hate me because your boyfriend thinks so.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-800">86. It's not that I don't listen to you when you talk. It's just that there is only so much stupid information I can process in one go.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">87. You're like the first slice of bread in a loaf. You get touched by everybody but wanted by none.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">88. I believe you can achieve anything. Look around you; there are remarkably dumb people everywhere who you could aspire to be.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">89. It seems your face caught fire, and somebody attempted to stop it with a hammer.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-800">91. Why don't you slip into something more comfortable, like a coma?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">92. I'm not stating you're stupid, but a glow stick has a better future than you have.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">93. It must be fun to wake up each morning knowing that you are that much closer to achieving your dreams of complete and utter mediocrity.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">94. You just might be why the middle finger was invented in the first place.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">95. You are evidence that evolution can go backwards.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">96. There's somebody out there for everybody. For you, it's a psychiatrist.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">97. If I had a face like yours, I would sue my parents.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">98. You have no idea how much joy you may spread just by leaving the room.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">99. I don't know if I should insult or congratulate you for saying something without drooling.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">100. It's kind of sad what happened to your face...Oh wait, that's how it has always looked?</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">101. Sometimes it's better to keep your lips shut and make people think you're ignorant than to open them and clear all doubt.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">102. I've heard a smarter statement come out in a fart.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">103. Hold still. I'm trying to imagine you with a personality.</p>

            <p className="text-gray-800">106. It's impossible to underestimate you.</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">107. I look at you and think, "Two billion years of evolution, for this?"</p>
            <p className="text-gray-800">108. Don't let your mind wander, it's too small to be let out by itself.</p>
